not gonna lie, i had this one in the works for quite a bit of time. this blog was originally created on january 23, 2025. \
\
i thought it would be really funny to have friends and possible spectators see what other people think of my blogs, so...i made a public forum for comments. 
all in all, this took about 2 partial days (i would say about 8-10 good hours) to complete. \
\

## design 
first off, let's make a schema. 

<BlogCode language="plaintext" copy="false" title="schema for accounts and comments">
{`
USERS
- userID: string non-null
- username: string non-null
- password: string non-null

SESSIONS
- sessionID: string non-null
- userID: string non-null
- dateCreated: date non-null

COMMENTS
- commentID: string non-null
- userID: string non-null
- blogID: string non-null
- dateCreated: date non-null
- content: string non-null
`}
</BlogCode>

...good enough.

<br />

next, i had to find a database. after (not) a lot of thinking, i decided to use mongodb. it is a database that i am familiar with, and it isnt too difficult to set up. 
using my knowledge from my web programming class, i started creating stuff.

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false" title="mongoconnection.js">
{`
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

let _connection = undefined;
let _db = undefined;

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';


const mongoConfig = {
  serverUrl: (env === "production") ? process.env.MONGO_SERVER_URL : process.env.MONGO_SERVER_URL_DEV,
  database: (env === "production") ? process.env.MONGO_DB_NAME : process.env.MONGO_DB_NAME_DEV,
}

const dbConnection = async () => {
  if (!_connection) {
    _connection = await MongoClient.connect(mongoConfig.serverUrl);
    _db = _connection.db(mongoConfig.database);
  }

  return _db;
};

const closeConnection = async () => {
  await _connection.close();
};

export { dbConnection, closeConnection };
`}
</BlogCode>

it should be noted that this is a general implementation of a mongodb connection. because of its 
template-like structure, it can be used in just about any node project that uses mongodb. there is 
also a difference between the production and development database. i dont want to mix up my stuff!
the development database is spun up locally on my computer, while the production database uses a mongo 
atlas cluster. i dont want to pay for a server, and thankfully, i dont have to. thanks mongo!! \
\
now, we make our collections. there were three collections that i had in mind (as shown in the schema above).

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false" title="mongocollections.js">
{`
import { dbConnection } from './mongoConnection.js';

const getCollectionFn = (collection) => {
  let _col = undefined;

  return async () => {
    if (!_col) {
      const db = await dbConnection();
      _col = await db.collection(collection);
    }

    return _col;
  };
};

export const accounts = getCollectionFn('accounts');
export const comments = getCollectionFn('comments');
export const sessions = getCollectionFn('sessions');
`}
</BlogCode>

the cool thing (that is not used in this project) is that mongodb does not require strictly defined schemas.
this can be useful - especially when you want to add new fields to a collection without having to worry about migrations. \
\
now, we have to make data functions. these functions will be used in the server side to interact with the database.
im not going to show the code for all of them, as that is quite annoying to read. you can always check my 
<a href="https://github.com/brrryry/personal-website" target="_blank">github</a> for the code. all in all, i made 
two files: `accounts.js` for account and session functions, and `comments.js` for comment functions. 

<BlogList>
<li>create/delete accounts</li>
<li>login/logout/session check</li>
<li>create/delete comments</li>
<li>get comments for a blog</li>
<li>get comments for a user</li>
</BlogList>

after i made these functions, i had to start actually throwing it all together in the client side.

## session management
in order to manage sessions, i used cookies. these cookies - for security purposes - would have to be validated
on the server side. in order to do this, i made a hook that would check if the user is logged in. it also had
login and logout functions. this hook is used in every necessary client componnt.

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false" title="sessioncontext.js">
{`
// components/SessionContext.js
'use client';

import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const SessionContext = createContext();

export function SessionProvider({children}) {
  const [session, setSession] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const sessionid = document.cookie.split('; ').find(row => row.startsWith('sessionid='))?.split('=')[1];
    const fetchSession = async (sessionid) => {
      try {
        //post request to /api/account/session
        const response = await fetch('/api/account/session', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: sessionid }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        setSession(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('error fetching session:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchSession(sessionid);
  }, []);

  const login = async (username, password) => {...}

  const logout = async () => {...};

  return (
    <SessionContext.Provider value={{ session, loading, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </SessionContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useSession() {
  const context = useContext(SessionContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useSession must be used within a SessionProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
`}
</BlogCode>

some examples of where this would be used would be...

<BlogList>
<li>the login page - if you are logged in, redirect out!!</li>
<li>the navbar component - show the login/logout button</li>
<li>the blog comments component - show the comment form if logged in</li>
</BlogList>

so...yeah, now we have an accurate way to tell on the client side if a user is logged in or not. awesome!

## the comments
since the blog itself is a server side rendered page, it was easy to stick on a blog comment component in the client side.
of course, in order to have the client interact with the server, i had to make a few api routes.

<BlogList>
<li>get /api/comments/:blogid - get all comments for a blog</li>
<li>post /api/comments/:blogid - create a comment for a blog</li>
<li>delete /api/comments/:commentid - delete a comment</li>
<li>put /api/comments/:commentid - update a comment</li>
<li>get /api/account/:userid - get all comments for a user (i bundled this with profile because im lazy)</li>
</BlogList>

alright, so now we have a way to comment and stuff. to recap... \
\
user logs in -> session is created, user is logged in \
user comments -> makes post request -> api calls create comment function -> comment is added to database \
\
cool. \
\
now, i hate frontend work (as you can tell by the style of this website). thus, i vibe-coded everything and just
hoped it worked. because of this, you may see some "accidentally" capitalized words. whoops. \
\
it was also quite a bit of code, so again im not gonna paste it all here. you can check it out on my github. in 
particular, making the edit button was a bit of a pain. holy moly. it also has a small span that shows
the relative time of the comment and the most recent edit.

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/pdev-ep3-accounts/sux.png"
alt="comment aesthetics"
caption="meh, looks aesthetic enough"
style={{border: "1px solid white"}}
/>

## the profile page
oh yeah, i also made a profile page so that everyone can see their comment history.
it looks like this!

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/pdev-ep3-accounts/profile.png"
alt="profile page"
caption="look at the cool lines!!"
style={{border: "1px solid white"}}
/>

once i figured out how to get this stuff working in the comment component, it was really easy to just paste
it into the profile page. looks pretty cool. \
\
also, when you click on a comment, it will take you to blog page that the comment is on. it will also
scroll to the comments section! how did i do this? \
\
simple. add a hash.

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false" title="/profile/[id]/page.js">
{`
return (
        <div className="flex justify-center items-center p-4">
            <div className="rounded shadow-md p-4 max-w-4xl">
                {error && <p className="text-red-500 mb-4">{error}</p>}
                <div className="mb-4">
                    <h3 className="block mb-2">username: {username}</h3>
                </div>

                <div className="mb-4 max-w-4xl">
                    <h3 className="block mb-2">comments</h3>
                    {comments.length > 0 ? (
                        <ul>
                            {comments.map(comment => (
                                <li key={comment._id} className="border-b py-2">
                                    <a href={\`/blog/\${comment.blogId}#comments-section\`} className="text-[#d8bfd8] hover:underline">
                                        {comment.blogId}
                                    </a> - {comment.content} {" "}
                                    <span className="text-sm">({new Date(comment.createdAt).toLocaleDateString()})</span>
                                    <span className="text-sm"> - {comment.updatedAt ? \`Updated: \${new Date(comment.updatedAt).toLocaleDateString()}\` : "Not updated"}</span>
                                    <br />
                                </li>
                            ))}
                        </ul>
...
`}
</BlogCode>

the important part is the `#comments-section` at the end of the link. this will scroll to the comments section of the blog page.
this works because i stuck some useeffect code in the blog comments page. hehehe >:3

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false" title="blogcomments.jsx">
{`
useEffect(() => {
        ... //other code

        // Wait for comments to render before scrolling
        const hash = window.location.hash;
        if (hash === "#comments-section") {
            setTimeout(() => {
            const commentsSection = document.querySelector(".comments-section");
            if (commentsSection) {
                commentsSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" });
            }
            }, 100); // slight delay to ensure DOM is ready
        }
    }, [blogId]);
`}
</BlogCode>

## conclusion
so now we have comments. that's cool. \
\
i could have definitely spent this time doing something else (like...job applications...or something), but i thought this would be fun. it wouldn't take too much time,
and i think the investment might be worth it (for fun, of course). thanks for reading, and i look forward to hearing back from you guys. \
\
for now, i will probably keep working on rag (see my other [blog](/blog/insure-2025)). please feel free to let me know if there is anything super buggy in the frontend...i havent fully tested it yet ahahaaaaa \
\
oh also i have admin perms obviously, so i can delete comments from the db itself lol \
\
one more thing: i really want to start posting music. maybe a blog will be made on that soon.

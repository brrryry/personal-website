preface: this is the first series blog on my website. if a tag has "series" in it,
that means that there are multiple blogs that are hidden under that tag.
you can access the hidden blogs by clicking the tag in the blog list (bryanchan.org/blog/\<tag\>).
for example, [here](/blog/tag/ms-dp100-series) is the tag for this series. \
\
this summer, i had the opportunity to go to the insure+e program in normal, illinois.

<s>i made a blog about it [here](/blog/insure-2025).</s> **this blog is removed.
the link does not work.** \ \ however, this was only part of my summer (most of
june). now, im back at home and continuing to work on what we started. however,
i need to do **more** if i want to get a job in this market. thus, i wanted
certifications. \ \ i looked online at dozens of applications (and applied to
most of them), and...not gonna lie, i got rejected. a **lot**. however, what i
also noticed is that a lot of data scientist jobs required knowledge in cloud
computing. in particular, i saw a lot of aws and azure requirements (and a bit
of gcp as well). so...i decided to prove that i knew this stuff. i have done my
fair share of projects, but they are all incomplete and not published. so, whats
the next best way to prove that i know this stuff? **certifications**. \ \
aight, lets do this.

<br />

## step 1: signing up <span id="step-1"/>

after some thinking, i decided to go with the microsoft dp-100 certification to start (as you can see in the title).
"azure data scientist associate". not a bad title!

/>

the first thing i did before anything else was sign up for a testing date.
i am someone that tends to procrastinate a lot if i dont have a deadline, so i set one.
my official testing date **is august 12th, 2025**. (note: i am using "is" because
at the time of writing this, i have not taken the test yet). \
\
the test fees were pretty intimidating, but i want to believe that it is
worth it in the long run. the test costed approximately **$91**, and i
decided to take it in person (i heard that taking it online was...quite annoying). \
\
great! im signed up. now, i have to study.

<br />

## step 2: study plan

so...im not really good at studying. that makes things hard... \
\
first off, i looked at the self-paced learning path.
microsoft seemed to estimate that it would take 18 hours to complete.
i have a month, and i am completely unemployed and free (aside from working on
the insure+e publication and polishing my website).
so, i decided to contribute 2 hours a day to looking at this course. \
\
after searching for valuable resources online (doomscrolling on reddit),
i found a few other places to study.

    - honestly, i wish i had found this earlier. they had a discount voucher if
    you completed the course. i could have paid half the price of the test ;-;

    - just...the sdk. it was strongly recommended by a lot of people to know it
    inside and out. i was already planning on using this beforehand!

  <li>
    measureup/skillcertpro(?) - practice test sites. kinda controversial in
    terms of effectiveness. still debating whether or not to use them.

    - has lots of implementations of the exercises in the course.

i plan to document my entire study notebook in a blog series (finally using the tags for something useful hehe) \
\
ill keep hyperlinking the sections as i go along, so you can check out blog by blog!

<br />

## step 3: the study series

(update 08/12: i...lowkey...skimmed the last module of the self-learning course. thus, there are no notes for it...)
[self-learning course module 1.1](/blog/ms-dp100-slc1) \
[self-learning course module 1.2](/blog/ms-dp100-slc2) \

<br />

## step 4: taking the test <span id="actual-test"/>

i have not taken the test yet, as it is set for august 12th. i will update this section
and keep writing beyond here once i take the test! :) \
\
(update 08/12: i have taken the test. i passed!! yay!!) \
\
the test itself was not too difficult, but it also was not easy.
i can confidently say that the microsoft self-learning course helped a sufficient amount.
microsoft's practice exam was helpful in terms of understanding basic content, but...do not expect
it to be on the same difficulty level of the actual exam. this is something that microsoft itself also states. \
\

\
also i really need to fix my website code. that will probably be my next blog
(unless by some miracle i finish ragsec before my own website??)

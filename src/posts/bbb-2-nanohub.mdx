## the intro
recently, i have had the privilege and honor of dating my girlfriend. 
personally, i think im very lucky to have her in my life.
however, she currently lives far away (like...12-13 hour drive far). \
\
i wanted to do something special for her birthday (which is coincidentally exactly one month after we started dating).
but...what do i do? it's not like i can just go to her house and give her a present. \
\
(well...i can...but i wouldnt deliver it myself, ig i would use amazon or something...)

<br />
## the brainstorming
i had a few ideas in mind to begin with...

<BlogList>
<li>**a 2d top down game** - trivia game, get different birthday wishes from people (disguised as npcs) and guess who theyre from</li>
<li>**a photo montage** - pictures of her!</li>
<li>**a drawing** - made through code! she can see it be drawn in real time</li>
<li>**a location choosing game** - choose a location to go to, and then we can go there together</li>
</BlogList>

however, all of these ideas felt wrong for different reasons. i will dive deeper into why in a bit, but i am (unfortunately) very insecure about gifts in general - i want them to be perfect. \
\
the trivia game would be too hard to make in the time that i had (especially with my small knowledge of game development). i tried to start it, but i just had a feeling that i wasnt experienced enough to make it in time.

<BlogImage

/>

the photo montage sounded too simple, and so did the drawing. the location choosing game would not be hard, but it has been done before. i didnt want to do something that seemed "generic". i didnt 
try to make any of these (as you can probably tell, the game was my best idea imo). \
\
after a lot of nothing, i decided to just make a little section on my website for her. its been a while since i made a new section, and it would motivate me to try to make something new (a bunch of new components)!
it was a win-win situation. 

<br />

## the website
i started by making a new section on my website. this part was...pretty easy.

<BlogImage

alt="image of the start of the website"
caption="the beautiful start"
style={{ border: "0.5rem white solid" }}
/>

i wanted to put pictures of her on the website, but i did not want everyone in the world to see them. thus, i ran into my first problem - authentication. \
\
i wanted to make a comment section box for my blogs anyway, so making a login system was already on my to-do list. this just finally gave me the motivation to actually do it. 

<br />

## the authentication
i started by spinning up a local mongodb instance. this database (for now, before comments) would have two
collections - one for users, and one for sessions. the user collection had a total of five fields. two
of them were used to determine if the user was "nano-approved" (allowed to see any of the content),
and if the user was "nano" (the user that the website is dedicated to). the other three fields were...
pretty basic.

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/bbb-2-nanohub/mongodb.png"
alt="image of the mongodb database seed"
caption="my basic mongodb seeding"
style={{ border: "0.5rem white solid" }}
/>

i created some data functions for the database. here's an example of one of them:

<BlogCode language="javascript" copy="false">
{`
const getAccountById = async (accountId) => {
  const accountCollection = await accounts();

  typecheck.isValidString(accountId, 'Account ID');

  if (!ObjectId.isValid(accountId)) {
    throw { status: 400, error: 'Invalid account ID format' };
  }

  const account = await accountCollection.findOne({
    _id: new ObjectId(accountId)
  }, {
    projection: { password: 0 } // Exclude password
  });

  if (!account) throw { status: 404, error: 'Account not found' };

  return account;
}
`}
</BlogCode>

a good amount of this initial code can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/brrryry/personal-website/commit/7db8f71f41bf00611d0fd9db35d2331d22c40c7e#diff-9f82b076cf9992dcec01453f475465bba0aed92c7d9202da22d3e856550171bc">
this commit</a>. apologies for the lack of detail in the commit message - i had to ask my dad to help me with the commit message 
because i had forgotten to push the code before i went to illinois for my summer research (blog coming soon?). \\
\\
after this, i created some basic api routes for the website. again, the commit above has all the code.
these routes were pretty simple to make, although i did have some issues with stringifying and de-stringifying for a bit.

aight, now we have to design the login and register pages.

<BlogCode language="javascript" title="src/components/Navbar.jsx" copy="false">
{`
"use client"

import Link from "next/link";
import { useSession } from "@/components/SessionContext";

const Login = () => {

    const {login, session, loading} = useSession();

    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        
        //get username and password
        const username = event.target[0].value;
        const password = event.target[1].value;

        //validate username and password
        try {
            await login(username, password);
            
            // go back to previous page or home page after successful login
            const previousPage = document.referrer || "/";

            // Redirect to the previous page or home page
            window.location.href = previousPage;
        } catch(err) {
            //console.error("Login failed:", err);
            // Show error message to user
            const errorElement = document.querySelector(".text-red-300");
            if (errorElement) {
                errorElement.classList.remove("hidden");
                errorElement.textContent = err.message.toLowerCase();
            }
        }

    }

    return (
        <div className="space-y-5 justify-center items-center flex flex-col">
        <h2>login</h2>
        <form className="flex flex-col space-y-3" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" placeholder="username" className="bg-gray-300 border p-2 rounded text-black" />
            <input type="password" placeholder="password" className="bg-gray-300 border p-2 rounded text-black" />
            <button type="submit" className="bg-[#6a0dad] text-white p-2 rounded">login</button>
        </form>
        <p>need an account? <Link href="/register">register</Link></p>
        <p className="text-red-300 hidden">this is error</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Login;
`}
</BlogCode>

lets see how it looks.

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/bbb-2-nanohub/login.png"
alt="image of the login page"
caption="aight, cool."
style={{ border: "0.5rem white solid" }}
/>

the next part is adjusting the navbar. it should say "login" if the user is not logged in, and "logout" if they are. \
\
in order to do this, i added a session context to the website. this context is used to store the session data, and it uses react hooks.
we can use this context to determine if the user is logged in or not. 

<BlogCode language="javascript" title="src/components/SessionContext.jsx" copy="false">
{`
// components/SessionContext.js
'use client';

import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const SessionContext = createContext();

export function SessionProvider({children}) {
  const [session, setSession] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    //get "sessionid" cookie
    const sessionid = document.cookie.split('; ').find(row => row.startsWith('sessionid='))?.split('=')[1];
    const fetchSession = async (sessionid) => {
      try {
        //post request to /api/account/session
        const response = await fetch('/api/account/session', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: sessionid }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        setSession(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('error fetching session:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchSession(sessionid);
  }, []);

  const login = async (username, password) => {
    //login code
  }

  const logout = async () => {
    //logout code
  };

  return (
    <SessionContext.Provider value={{ session, loading, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </SessionContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useSession() {
  const context = useContext(SessionContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useSession must be used within a SessionProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
`}
</BlogCode>

now, we can use this context in our navbar component.

<BlogCode language="javascript" title="/src/login/page.jsx" copy="false">
{`
"use client"

import Link from "next/link";
import { useState } from "react";
import { useSession } from "./SessionContext";

const Navbar = () => {
  const { session, loading, logout } = useSession();
  const [mobileOpen, setMobileOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleLogout = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    try {
      await logout();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Logout failed:", error);
    }
    window.location.href = "/";
  };


  return (
    ...
    {session?.sessionId && !loading && (
        <li>
        <Link href="/" onClick={handleLogout}>
            <p className="text-2xl text-purple-200 font-bold">logout</p>
        </Link>
        </li>
    )}
    {!session?.sessionId && !loading && (
        <li>
        <Link href="/login">
            <p className="text-2xl text-purple-200 font-bold">login</p>
        </Link>
        </li>
    )}
    ...
  );
};

export default Navbar;
`}
</BlogCode>

nice. note that this took a lot of time to get right. at first, 
i tried to make a ``middleware.js`` file to check if the user was logged in instead of a hook, but this
ended up failing because it had to load the full mongodb driver. i also didn't know exactly
how to make the session provider, so it took quite a bit of research. again, all the code can be seen
in my commit history if you want to follow my fully raw train of thought. \
\
cool! now we start the nanohub.

<br />

## the nanohub
i wanted to make a little space for her. wouldnt that be cool :D \
\
so! i started by making...a page. she likes flowers, so i had an idea:
what if i made a garden of time for her? one flower for each year.
i wanted to make something that was originally all mine, so...i had to draw. unfortunately,
im not very good.

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/bbb-2-nanohub/drawing.png"
alt="image of the flower drawing"
caption="chat is this a peony????"
style={{ border: "0.5rem white solid" }}
/>

i wanted this space to be a single page application, but this came to be quite a challenge.
the first thing that i wanted to do was make a secret letter for her.
here was what the component structure looked like at the time:

<BlogCode language="plaintext" copy="false">
{`
/nano/page.js (server side)
 - NanoHub (client side - requires nano-approved)
  - NanoHubHome (client side?)
  - Nano2025 (client side)
   - Nano2025Secret (client side - incorrect - requires nano)
`}
</BlogCode>

i made it complicated like this because i wanted to be able to animate the switch 
between components (nanohubhome and nano2025). i wanted to make it so that when you clicked on a button, it would animate
a fade in/out. \
\
i originally made the mistake of making the secret component client side, which...leaks
the secret. the component may not be hydrated on the page, but a tech-savvy user could
easily find the code in the source. \
\
the pain of having to make it server side was quite annoying. i tried to come up with
this architecture using interleaved server and client components:

<BlogCode language="plaintext" copy="false">
{`
/nano/page.js (server side)
 - NanoHub (client side)
  - NanoHubHomeWrapper (server side)
    - NanoHubHome (client side)
  - Nano2025Wrapper (server side)
   - Nano2025Secret (server side)
`}
</BlogCode>

this still doesn't work, because i want the 2025 component to also be animated.
i wanted the message to appear after the animation, so i had to make it client side.
how do i do this????? \
\
after a bunch of vibe coding, i finally decided to think. i realized it was simpler than i thought.

<BlogCode language="plaintext" copy="false">
{`
/nano/page.js (server side)
 - NanoHub (client side)
  - NanoHubHome (client side)
  - Nano2025 (client side)
   - Nano2025Secret (server side)
`}
</BlogCode>

this...works. basically, i import the 2025 secret in the page.js file.
then, i make a dictionary.

<BlogCode language="javascript" title="page.js (.jsx)" copy="false">
{`
const secretMessages = {
    2025: isNano ? [<Nano2025Secret />] : null,
    // other years...}
`}
</BlogCode>

this dictionary is set conditionally based on the user's session.
from there, i return the nanohub component as follows: ``NanoHub secretMessages={secretMessages}``. \
\
whenever i need to render the nano2025 component from nanohub, i do this:

<BlogCode language="javascript" title="nano hub (.jsx)" copy="false">
{`
return (
        <Nano2025 switchYear={switchYear} >
          {secretMessages[2025]}
        </Nano2025>
    );
`}
</BlogCode>

as a reminder, the dictionary secret messages is either the secret message (if logged in), or null (if not logged in).
all i have to do now is render the secret message if it exists.

## conclusion
and that's it! the rest was all styling and making the page look nice. \
\
i don't want to share the source code, but you can see the final product at <a href="/nano">this link</a>. \
if you want to get nano-approved, reach out to me! it's not like there's much you can see now, but i will be adding more content in the future. \
\
please let me know if there are any errors hehe \
\
this is another unstructured blog post (because tbh im lazy), but i hope you enjoyed it! next blog will
probably be on summer research or a comment section system. woohoo!! \
\
to nano, i hope you have a great birthday. cheers to a month of dating, and many more to come.

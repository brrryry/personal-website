you know, this was something that i was originally planning to do...as a joke in elementary school. 
like...an "oh haha im so smart" kinda joke. well, turns out that joke is only half a joke. \
\
after doing some "real world" work in high school and doing research in undergrad/grad, i realized that i actually
enjoy research more. it feels more fulfilling to me, and i like the idea of contributing to new knowledge. \
\
so here i am, applying to phd programs for fall 2026.

## motivations <span id="motivations" />
why a phd? well, as i said before, research is one of my reasons. however, there are a few more. \
\
even if i couldnt do all the research i wanted to do, there is another thing i would like to do: teach.
ive attended my fair share of lectures as a college student, and i have worked as a course assistant for a myriad of classes.
each class required me to do different things from running labs outside class to troubleshooting in class
to grading homework assignments and exams. \
\
i really enjoy the process. ive been told that my teaching skills are decent,
and it makes me happy. of course, im not gonna exaggerate it, but it is a delightful process
to see students learn if they are truly interested in the topic. on top of that,
being in an environment for learning enforces me to learn from students too!
its a positive feedback loop of knowledge. \
\
in order to reliably become such a teacher, i would need to have a phd (as most colleges require it). \

this is my overview/notes for the first module of the microsoft dp-100 self-learning course! 
i hope you find this helpful :)

### day 1 (july 11th)
started the "explore azure machine learning workspace resources and assets" module.

/>

the first two submodules detail what is in a machine learning service (the workspace) as well as how to create one.
in order to make one, you need to:

<BlogList>
<li>get access to an azure account and subscription (as you do with most cloud services)</li>
<li>create a resource group (aka a container to organize an azure "solution")</li>
<li>create a machine learning workspace (the actual service - "workspace" and "service" seem to be used interchangeably)</li>
</BlogList>

there are multiple ways to do the last step as well, those methods being:

<BlogList>
<li>using the azure portal (yay, fancy ui)</li>
<li>using the azure command line interface (cli)</li>
<li>using the python sdk</li>
</BlogList>

i tried to create a workspace using the azure portal, and it was pretty straightforward.
in the future, i would like to try using the sdk. clis are usually not my thing, and i prefer using either the 
portal of the sdk for the time being. they provided some nice code snippets though!

<BlogCode language="python" title="creating workspace (ripped from the material)" copy="false">
{`
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Workspace

workspace_name = "mlw-example"

ws_basic = Workspace(
    name=workspace_name,
    location="eastus",
    display_name="Basic workspace-example",
    description="This example shows how to create a basic workspace",
)
ml_client.workspaces.begin_create(ws_basic)
`}
</BlogCode>

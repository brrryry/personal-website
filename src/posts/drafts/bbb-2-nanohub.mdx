## the intro
recently, i have had the privilege and honor of dating my girlfriend. 
personally, i think im very lucky to have her in my life.
however, she currently lives far away (like...12-13 hour drive far). \
\
i wanted to do something special for her birthday (which is coincidentally exactly one month after we started dating).
but...what do i do? it's not like i can just go to her house and give her a present. \
\
(well...i can...but i wouldnt deliver it myself, ig i would use amazon or something...)

<br />
## the brainstorming
i had a few ideas in mind to begin with...

<BlogList>
<li>**a 2d top down game** - trivia game, get different birthday wishes from people (disguised as npcs) and guess who theyre from</li>
<li>**a photo montage** - pictures of her!</li>
<li>**a drawing** - made through code! she can see it be drawn in real time</li>
<li>**a location choosing game** - choose a location to go to, and then we can go there together</li>
</BlogList>

however, all of these ideas felt wrong for different reasons. i will dive deeper into why in a bit, but i am (unfortunately) very insecure about gifts in general - i want them to be perfect. \
\
the trivia game would be too hard to make in the time that i had (especially with my small knowledge of game development). i tried to start it, but i just had a feeling that i wasnt experienced enough to make it in time.

the photo montage sounded too simple, and so did the drawing. the location choosing game would not be hard, but it has been done before. i didnt want to do something that seemed "generic". i didnt 
try to make any of these (as you can probably tell, the game was my best idea imo). \
\
after a lot of nothing, i decided to just make a little section on my website for her. its been a while since i made a new section, and it would motivate me to try to make something new (a bunch of new components)!
it was a win-win situation. 

<br />

## the website
i started by making a new section on my website. this part was...pretty easy.

i wanted to put pictures of her on the website, but i did not want everyone in the world to see them. thus, i ran into my first problem - authentication. \
\
i wanted to make a comment section box for my blogs anyway, so making a login system was already on my to-do list. this just finally gave me the motivation to actually do it.

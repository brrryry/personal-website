here is my overview of module 1.2 of the microsoft dp-100 self-learning course. \
\
overall, the content will cover more of the tools that can be used to interact with resources/assets (the portal, cli, sdk, etc.).

<br />

## submodules 1-2: the studio
this submodule covers the portal and the machine learning studio. most of this was covered in the previous module ([blog here](/blog/ms-dp100-slc1-1)). \
\
it details the things you can do and the sections.

<BlogList>
<li>**author** - create new jobs, notebooks and automl stuff</li>
<li>**assets** - create/review assets (general logical entities)</li>
<li>**manage** - create/manage resources (compute, storage, data labels, etc.)</li>
</BlogList>

it is generally advised to use the sdk/cli for more repetetive/automated tasks, but the portal is great for quick experimentation. 

<br />

## submodule 3: the python sdk
this submodule covers how to install and use the python sdk in general.
thankfully, it was pretty easy to follow along with the course, as i had already been using python for a while. \
\
azure has their sdk available for installation using pip!

```
pip install azure-ai-ml
something else
```

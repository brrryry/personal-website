**note**: while this article may intonate like i know what im doing, all topics mentioned are purely my own opinion based on my experience. i am not a coach (in fact, i actively fear it), and i am not a pro.
im just a guy who plays badminton. \
\
without further ado, let's get started. it's been a while since i've actually published anything (i do have several drafts in the works right now though!). i've had this idea in mind for a while, but 
i never really got around to writing it. that being said, my friend wanted to play badminton with me, and i thought it would be a good time to write this article. 

<br />

## who am i?
in case you don't know, i'm bryan - i created this website. in terms of badminton experience... \
\
i used to play with my family a lot when i was little (just outdoor badminton). in early middle school, i took up tennis and got trained for a while. from there, my interest in badminton began to fully blossom in high school. since 
i had already had experience playing tennis, i was able to pick up badminton pretty quickly. i enjoyed the sport throughout my high school years, and i ended up joining my college's badminton club. throughout these years, i learned a lot about
the theory of the sport (alhtough i have only recently started to work on practical form). \
\
well, that's my experience so far. let's just hop into the basics.

(if you already know how the game works, skip!)

## the basics
i assume that you know how to hit the birdie, so let's go into the rules of the game.

this is a badminton court. the each of the lines have significance.

<br />

### singles

<BlogImage

/>

in singles, you play on the inner lines of the court (at least on the left and right). the inner back lines of the court are not used. \
\
the service lines are at the front (closest to the net). if you are serving, you are not allowed to hit the birdie anywhere short of the service lines. on top of this, if you are serving, you must serve cross-court (diagonally).
after the serve, the service lines as well as the center line (to denote the left and right sides) are not used.

<br />

### on serving and points
let's talk points. \
\
in badminton, you typically play to 21 points. when you win a point, you get to serve. if you have an even number of points (0, 2, 4, etc.), you serve from the right side of the court. if you have an odd number of points (1, 3, 5, etc.), you serve from the left side of the court. 
if you are serving, you must serve from the correct side of the court. \
\
for example...

<BlogList>
<li>bob and alice are playing. they start at 0-0. bob serves first.</li>
<li>bob serves from the right side. he wins the point. the score is now 1-0.</li>
<li>bob serves from the left side (since he has 1 point). he wins the point. the score is now 2-0.</li>
<li>bob serves from the right side (since he has 2 points). alice wins the point. the score is now 2-1 </li>
<li>alice serves from the left side (since she has 1 point). she wins the point. the score is now 2-2.</li>
<li>so on, so forth...</li>
</BlogList>

**when serving (formally), you must serve with the birdie below your waist.**  \
\
okay, back to the game.

<br />

### doubles

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/badminton-learned/doubles.png"
alt="image of badminton court with doubles lines"
caption="playing doubles!"
source="https://www.badminton.org.au/about-badminton/"
/>

in singles, the outer lines are used, and the inner lines (which denoted singles' left and right bounds) are now discarded. the inner back lines of the court are now used - you are not allowed to serve further than that line. 
after the serve, those inner back lines are also discarded.
all other lines apply the same way. you must still serve cross court.

<br />

# the theory
now, let's start talking theory. when i say theory, it's not like this stuff can't be applied in practice - it is just not part of the basic rules of the game. i will classify theory into a few sections:

<BlogList>
<li>footwork</li>
<li>strokes</li>
<li>singles specifics</li>
<li>doubles specifics</li>
</BlogList>

okay, let's start.

<br />

## footwork
footwork is the most important part of badminton. if you don't have good footwork, you won't be able to get to the birdie and hit it properly.
now - i will preface this by saying that my footwork...is pretty trash. this is one of my weakest points of the game. that being said, i can still at least explain some concepts. \
\
from my understanding, there are two main objectives that must be achieved in order to play this sport well: **increasing your speed** and **increasing your ability to change direction**. \
\
on top of this, footwork can be decomposed into various moves (not all of which are listed here) which can help you achieve these objectives. for example...

<BlogList>
<li>lunge - a quick long step in a forward-like angle</li>
<li>split step - a quick hop to anticipate a shot</li>
<li>chasse step/shuffle - a quick skip to manuever small to mid distances</li>
</BlogList>

<br />

### increasing your speed
there are many ways to go about increasing your speed. one of the more common ways of doing so is **taking less steps to get to the birdie**. for example, using
a single lunge to get a drop shot at the front of your court is much better than taking 3 steps to get there. this can also save energy over the long term. \
\
another way to increase your speed is to memorize what foot to use when you are moving. by extension, you can also **memorize the entire sequence of steps you need to take to get to the birdie**. 
this way, you don't have to think about it when you are playing - you can just do it and save yourself some time. for example, i am aware that i will need to take three steps to get from the center of the court to the back left.

<BlogImage

alt="badminton diagram with footwork example"
caption="footwork example: back left"
/>

i would step back with my left foot, hop backward onto my left foot again and then take a wide step back with my right foot. while i don't know if this is "fundamentally" correct, this is - at the very least - memorized for me.
this way, i don't waste time thinking about how to move - i just move. \
\
personally, i am a believer that there is no real "correct" way to move, as everyone is different. we can all find our most efficient way to move through rigorous trial and error. the important part is that you practice
how to make your movement more efficient. \
\
of course, **cardio is extremely important when it comes to speed as well**. there is no point to thinking fast and memorizing your moves if your body isn't able to keep up. there are several ways to get your cardio up, including
(but not limited to):

<BlogList>
<li>running - specfically short-mid distance runs at a faster pace</li>
<li>various footwork drills - even shadow drills are good as long as you put real effort into it</li>
<li>playing more badminton!</li>
</BlogList>


### increasing your ability to change direction
deceptive shots are surprisingly common and important in badminton. they force you to move in a different direction that is unexpected, using up stamina as well as time.
with this in mind, being able to counter such shots are also extremely important. even if a shot isn't deceptive, it might just not be super predictable. \
\
one of the best ways to achieve this is by **using a split step** (as mentioned earlier). the split step is a quick hop that allows you to get into a ready position (wider stance).
the objective is to land right when your opponent hits the birdie. the idea behind this hop is that your legs will be primed to move in any direction. 

<br />

### other points
some more tips that i don't think will fit into any of the above categories:

<BlogList>
<li>**keep your knees bent enough** - this will help you move faster and change direction more easily</li>
<li>**try to be on the balls of your feet as much as possible** - being on your heels will make it much harder to move quickly</li>
</BlogList>

the most common drill that our club uses is **four corners**. this is a drill where one person feeds the birdie to any corner of the court, forcing the other person to move to that corner and return the shot to the feeder.
this is a very exhausting drill, but it is also very effective. \
\
that's all for footwork! let's keep moving.

<br />

## strokes
strokes refer to the actual act of hitting the birdie. there are many different classifications of strokes, but i will only discuss the most common ones.

<BlogList>
<li>**clear** - a stroke where you hit the birdie upwards at a steep angle</li>
<li>**smash** - a stroke where you hit the birdie downwards at a steep angle</li>
<li>**drop** - a stroke where you hit the birdie downwards at a shallow angle</li>
<li>**drive** - a stroke where you hit the birdie straight at your opponent</li>
<li>**net** - a stroke where you hit the birdie at the net</li>
<li>**lift** - a stroke where you hit the birdie upwards at a shallow angle</li>
</BlogList>

of course, each of these shots have their **forehand** and **backhand** variants. kinda complicated. 

<br />

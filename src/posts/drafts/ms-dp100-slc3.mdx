## module 1 - running a training script as a command jobs
in this module, we get more into production workloads.
we want to turn notebooks into scripts to make model training processes easily comparable and
reproducible. this includes doing the following steps (cited directly from the course):

<BlogList>
<li>**removing non-essential code** - debug/redundant print statements, stuff like that</li>
<li>**converting cells into functions** - this is a good practice in general!</li>
<li>**script testing** - making sure that the script can work in a pipeline (this is why functions are important)</li>
</BlogList>

<BlogCode title="example of refactored code from the course" language="python" copy="false">
{`
def main(csv_file):
    # read data
    df = get_data(csv_file)

    # split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(df)

# function that reads the data
def get_data(path):
    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    
    return df

# function that splits the data
def split_data(df):
    X, y = df[['Pregnancies','PlasmaGlucose','DiastolicBloodPressure','TricepsThickness',
    'SerumInsulin','BMI','DiabetesPedigree','Age']].values, df['Diabetic'].values

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
`}
</BlogCode>

from here, once your code is refactored, you need to interact with the azure ml sdk to run the script as a command job.
i kinda hard a hard time wrapping my head around this, so i had to review the difference between...

<BlogList>
<li>**command job** - a job that runs a script</li>
<li>**experiment** - a collection of jobs</li>
<li>**pipeline** - a collection of jobs that are connected together</li>
<li>**run** - a single execution of a job</li>
</BlogList>

<BlogCode title="example of creating a command job" language="python" copy="false">
{`
from azure.ai.ml import command

# configure job
job = command(
    code="./src",
    command="python train.py --training_data training.csv",
    environment="AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest",
    compute="aml-cluster",
    display_name="train-model",
    experiment_name="train-classification-model"
    )
`}
</BlogCode>

one important part is the ``command`` parameter. you are able to pass arguments using python's ``argparse`` library!
this becomes really useful when you want to train a model only slightly differently. \
\
thats honestly about it for this module (or at least in terms of key takeaways). the amount of content in this module was small
but vital in real applications.

<br />

## module 2: tracking model training with mlflow
in the last module, we introduced the concept of command jobs and scripts. however, because of this, logging becomes slightly more difficult.
to fix this, microsoft implemented **mlflow**. \
\
mlflow is an open-source platform that was originally made by <a href="https://databricks.com/" target="_blank">databricks</a> to manage the machine learning lifecycle, and 
it provides a way to log metrics, parameters, and artifacts. \
\
mlflow provides both automatic (``mlflow.autolog()``) and manual (``mlflow.log_*()``) logging capabilities.
setting up mlflow is fairly straightforward in the sdk. you need to install two packages:

<BlogCode language="bash" title="installing mlflow (sdk)" copy="false">
{`
pip install mlflow
pip install azureml-mlflow
`}
</BlogCode>

autologging is supported by a variety of libraries. an image is provided below for reference!

<BlogImage
src="/blogs/ms-dp100/slc/3/suplib.png"
alt="list of supported libraries"
caption="that is - in fact - quite a few"
source="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/train-models-training-mlflow-jobs/2-track-metrics-mlflow"
/>

when you want to log manually, you have three basic options:

<BlogList>
<li>mlflow.log_param(key, value): log a key-value parameter value (usually input parameters)</li>
<li>mlflow.log_metric(key, value): log a key-value metric value (must be a number!!!)</li>
<li>mlflow.log_artifact(local_path, artifact_path): log a file</li>
</BlogList>

metrics that are logged can be viewed in the studio by going to ``studio > experiment run > details > metrics``.
the view of these metrics (as well as charts and whatnot) can be edited in the ml studio.

<BlogImage

source="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=interactive%2Ccli"
/>

metrics can also be retrieved in a notebook. first, you have to locate the experiment/run. there are
several ways to do this - you can search the all mlflow experiments using ``mlflow.search_experiments()``
or search by name using ``mlflow.get_experiment_by_name()`. once the experiment is retrieved, you can
search for runs using ``mlflow.search_runs(experiment.experiment_id)``. \
\
for more information on how to use these functions, the documentation always comes in handy!

## module 3: hyperparameter tuning with azure
as with any machine learning project, hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step.
the term "hyper" is used because these "parameters" cannot be adjusted - like weights and biases - during training. 
instead, they are set before the training process begins and remain constant. some examples of hyperparameters would be...

<BlogList>
<li>learning rate</li>
<li>batch size</li>
<li>number of epochs</li>
<li>optimizer function</li>
</BlogList>

in order to tune these hyperparameters, a validation set (as opposed to a **training** and **testing** set) is used.
this validation set tests the performance of different hyperparameter combinations and helps to find the best one. \
\
azure provides a few ways of doing hyperparameter tuning, and they go over it in this module. \
\
some hyperparameters (such as the number of epochs) are discrete, while others (such as learning rate) are continuous. it is important to note the difference.
the possible hyperparameters that can be selected is called the "search space".
azure does this by creating classes for each type of hyperparameter. for example, the `Choice` class is used for discrete hyperparameters, while the `Uniform` class is used for continuous hyperparameters. \
\
(tangent: it is very cool that azure has quantile distributions for discrete variables.) 

<BlogCode language="python" title="creating a search space for hyperparameter tuning" copy="false">
{`
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice, Normal

command_job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),    
    learning_rate=Normal(mu=10, sigma=3),
)
`}
</BlogCode>

when choosing these hyperparameter combinations, there are a few sampling methods that azure implements:

<BlogList>
<li>**random sampling**: samples hyperparameter combinations randomly from the search space</li>
<li>**sobol sampling**: almost the same as random sampling, but uses a seed to make the results reproducible</li>
<li>**grid sampling**: samples hyperparameter combinations from a predefined "grid" of discrete combinations</li>
<li>**bayesian sampling**: uses past performance to sample better hyperparameter combinations</li>
</BlogList>

when calling a sweep job (the job used for hyperparameter tuning), one of the parameters is ``sampling_algorithm``. there, you can specify the sampling method to use. \
\
azure also supports early termination for tuning. 
if a new tuning doesnt result in an improvement, the sweep job can be stopped. this saves computing power! \
\
the sweep job early termination feature has two main parameters:

<BlogList>
<li>**evaluation_interval**: the interval at which the early termination policy is checked</li>
<li>**delay_evaluation**: the number of trials to wait before starting to evaluate the performance of the current best trial</li>
</BlogList>

for example, if you wanted the early termination to - at earliest - be at the fifth trial and wanted to check if early
termination is possible on every other trial, you would set ``evaluation_interval=2`` and ``delay_evaluation=5``. \
\
as for the policies themselves, there are a few policies that azure implements:

<BlogList>
<li>**bandit policy** - uses a "slack factor / slack amount". any new model must perform within the slack range of the best current model.</li>
<li>**median stopping policy** - any new model must perform better than the median performance of primary metrics</li>
<li>**truncation policy** - any new model must perform better than the worst percentage (arbitrary) of models in the current batch</li>
</BlogList>

mlflow (from the last module) should be used to track the performance of hyperparameter tuning jobs,
and a script should be made for tuning.

i dont want to steal code directly from the website, so ill just cite the website section itself here.
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/perform-hyperparameter-tuning-azure-machine-learning-pipelines/5-use-sweep-job-hyperparameter-tuning" target="_blank">here</a>
is an example of a hyperparameter tuning sweep job.

<br />

## module 4: pipelines
pipelines. they are pretty important. 
they can be used to automate/visualize the machine learning lifecycle.
by making each step a separate job, you can easily swap out different components (e.g. data preprocessing, model training) without affecting the entire pipeline. \
\
thankfully, azure uses these. \
\
in order to make a component (a "module" of the pipeline), 
you need to create a yaml file that defines the component's inputs, outputs, and behavior.

<BlogCode language="yml" title="example component yml file" copy="false">
{`
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/commandComponent.schema.json
name: example
display_name: Example Component!!
version: 1
type: command
inputs:
  input_data: 
    type: uri_file
outputs:
  output_data:
    type: uri_file
code: ./src
environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest
command: >-
  python example.py 
  --input_data \${{inputs.input_data}}
  --output_data \${{outputs.output_data}}
`}
</BlogCode>

loading the component in the python sdk is fairly simple with the ``load_component`` function.

<BlogCode language="python" title="loading component" copy="false">
{`
from azure.ai.ml import load_component
parent_dir = ""

loaded_component_example = load_component(source=parent_dir + "./example.yml")
`}
</BlogCode>

this component can be registered on the azure ml workspace using the ``mlclient.components.create_or_update`` method. \
\
once we have components for the pipeline, we need to build the pipeline itself.
for example (from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/run-pipelines-azure-machine-learning/3-create-pipeline" target="_blank">azure website</a>),
lets say we have a prep data component and a train model component. \
\
to create a pipeline function, we use the pipeline class.

<BlogCode language="python" title="creating a pipeline function">
{`
from azure.ai.ml.dsl import pipeline

@pipeline()
def pipeline_function_name(pipeline_job_input):
    prep_data = loaded_component_prep(input_data=pipeline_job_input)
    train_model = loaded_component_train(training_data=prep_data.outputs.output_data)

    return {
        "pipeline_job_transformed_data": prep_data.outputs.output_data,
        "pipeline_job_trained_model": train_model.outputs.model_output,
    }
`}
</BlogCode>

this function can then be called and provided with the necessary inputs to the first component.

<BlogCode language="python" title="calling pipeline function">
{`
from azure.ai.ml import Input
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

pipeline_job = pipeline_function_name(
    Input(type=AssetTypes.URI_FILE, 
    path="azureml:data:1"
))
`}
</BlogCode>

if you try printing this `pipeline_job`, you should see the details of the pipeline job in a yaml format. \
\
to run the pipeline job, you can use the ``mlclient.jobs.create_or_update`` function.
it should be noted that the ``create_or_update`` notation is used commonly throughout azure ml. \
\
from here, you can monitor the experiment progress in the ml studio. \

pipelines can also be scheduled using the ``jobschedule`` function.
this is where pipelines becomes especially useful for automation, as you can retrain models
on a recurring basis using a pipeline!

## conclusion!
overall, i think this third module was...a little "all over the place".
given that the title was "optimize model training", i guess there are quite a few ways to do that, and
the module did a good job at highlighting the various techniques that could be used. \
\
i really liked that they went heavy into automation and production-level practices.
overall, this was probably my favorite module so far. maybe its because im scatter-brained and 
like to take various different topics at a time, but this was fun! \
\
as a note for future reference, i only did the hyperparameter tuning lab and tinkered with
basic scheduling on azure. i would like to revisit and do the other labs if possible! \
\
on a completely different note, i recently started playing ranked league of legends.
i got promoted to iron 3!! (still dont know how to play the game...)

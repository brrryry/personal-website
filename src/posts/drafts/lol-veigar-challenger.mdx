## the grind
i started playing league of legends in 2015, and i have been playing veigar since 2016. \
i have always loved the champion, but i never really took the game seriously until 2020. \
i started playing ranked in 2020, and i have been climbing ever since. \
i have always wanted to hit challenger, but i never really thought it was possible. \
however, i decided to go for it in 2024. \
i started playing veigar full-time in ranked, and i was determined to hit challenger. \
i played a lot of games, and i learned a lot about the champion and the game. \
i finally hit challenger in july 2025, and it was an amazing feeling. \
i was so happy to finally achieve my goal after all these years. \

i learned a lot about veigar and the game while grinding to challenger. \
here are some of the key things i learned:

recently, i went to japan! it was a fun trip. \
\
i got to stay in an airbnb in taito city (tokyo) for a little over a week with some friends. \
\
i wanted to write this post to remember the trip, share my experiences and give some tips! 

<br />

## preparing 
to be honest, i didn't think i was gonna go with my friends when they first planned the trip. i was a hesitant for a few reasons:

<BlogList>
<li> i had never traveled internationally before </li>
<li> i was not conversational in japanese (i only knew a few phrases) </li>
<li> i was a broke college student </li>
</BlogList>

however, i decided impulsively to book a flight one night (sometime in october), and...i guess i was set to go! \
**the trip was set to be from january 11th to january 20th.**

<br />

at the time, i had approximately $2400 in my bank account. i was a bit worried about the cost of the trip, but i figured that i could make it work.
all in all, the cost of the trip was...

<BlogList>
<li> $919 for the round trip flight (united airlines to/from narita international airport)</li>
<li> $267 for the airbnb (per person for 8 nights) </li>
<li> $40 for a night at the <a href="https://www.art-narita.com/en-us/">art hotel narita</a></li>
<li> $60 for a general day trip (including food, transportation, etc.) </li>
<li> $50 for general transportation </li>
<li> $270 for food </li>
<li> $400 for entertainment </li>
</BlogList>

all in all, the trip cost me **$2006 for 9 days ($222ish per day)**. i was pretty happy with that. my bank account may be crying, but i am most certainly not. \
\
with the money budget (which was pretty close to what i actually spent) out of the way, i had to pack.

i didn't pack too much, since i knew that i was going to buy a lot of stuff in japan. i brought a backpack and a half-empty checked suitcase to the airport.

## the flight to japan
this was my first time flying for such a long time (14 hours). i was a bit nervous, but i was also excited. my parents bought me some compression socks to wear on the flight,
and they helped tremendously in kepeing my legs from swelling. i also planned to use my downed jacket as a blanket. \
\
my original idea was to not sleep before my flight (11am) in order to match the time zone of japan and have no jet lag upon landing. however, i did not realize how hard it was to sleep on a plane. 
unfortunately, i only ended up getting about 2-3 hours of sleep on the plane, and i spent a lot of the time watching downloaded anime. \
\
in retrospect, i probably should have prepared myself to sleep a little more by taking some sleeping medication beforehand.

## the first day
since i booked my flight at a different time from my friends, they were set to land a couple hours after me. i spent a good amount of my down time walking around the airport and checking out the stores.
i was pretty astonished at how english-friendly everything was. i was able to navigate the airport with ease. i developed a new level of respect for japanese education - it seems that english is taught really well in japan. \
\
after all my friends and i landed, we walked around the airport to find the train station. we had to figure out how to buy suica cards (the train cards that we wanted).

we took the train to our airbnb, and we were pretty tired. we decided to go to a nearby sushi place for dinner. it was a little expensive compared to normal japanese food, but it was well worth it.

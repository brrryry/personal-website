recently, i went to japan! it was a fun trip. \
\
i got to stay in an airbnb in taito city (tokyo) for a little over a week with some friends. \
\
i wanted to write this post to remember the trip, share my experiences and give some tips! 

<br />

## preparing 
to be honest, i didn't think i was gonna go with my friends when they first planned the trip. i was a hesitant for a few reasons:

<BlogList>
<li> i had never traveled internationally before </li>
<li> i was not conversational in japanese (i only knew a few phrases) </li>
<li> i was a broke college student </li>
</BlogList>

however, i decided impulsively to book a flight one night (sometime in october), and...i guess i was set to go! \
**the trip was set to be from january 11th to january 20th.**

<br />

at the time, i had approximately $2400 in my bank account. i was a bit worried about the cost of the trip, but i figured that i could make it work.
all in all, the cost of the trip was...

<BlogList>
<li> $919 for the round trip flight (united airlines to/from narita international airport)</li>
<li> $267 for the airbnb (per person for 8 nights) </li>
<li> $40 for a night at the <a href="https://www.art-narita.com/en-us/">art hotel narita</a></li>
<li> $60 for a general day trip (including food, transportation, etc.) </li>
<li> $50 for general transportation </li>
<li> $270 for food </li>
<li> $400 for entertainment </li>
</BlogList>

all in all, the trip cost me **$2006 for 9 days ($222ish per day)**. i was pretty happy with that. my bank account may be crying, but i am most certainly not. \
\
with the money budget (which was pretty close to what i actually spent) out of the way, i had to pack.

i didn't pack too much, since i knew that i was going to buy a lot of stuff in japan. i brought a backpack and a half-empty checked suitcase to the airport.

<br />

## the flight to japan
this was my first time flying for such a long time (14 hours). i was a bit nervous, but i was also excited. my parents bought me some compression socks to wear on the flight,
and they helped tremendously in kepeing my legs from swelling. i also planned to use my downed jacket as a blanket. \
\
my original idea was to not sleep before my flight (11am) in order to match the time zone of japan and have no jet lag upon landing. however, i did not realize how hard it was to sleep on a plane. 
unfortunately, i only ended up getting about 2-3 hours of sleep on the plane, and i spent a lot of the time watching downloaded anime. \
\
in retrospect, i probably should have prepared myself to sleep a little more by taking some sleeping medication beforehand.

## the first day
since i booked my flight at a different time from my friends, they were set to land a couple hours after me. i spent a good amount of my down time walking around the airport and checking out the stores.
i was pretty astonished at how english-friendly everything was. i was able to navigate the airport with ease. i developed a new level of respect for japanese education - it seems that english is taught really well in japan. \
\
after all my friends and i landed, we walked around the airport to find the train station. we had to figure out how to buy suica cards (the train cards that we wanted).

we took the train to our airbnb, and we were pretty tired. we decided to go to a nearby sushi place for dinner. it was a little expensive compared to normal japanese food, but it was well worth it.

<br />

## january 12th: kamakura

<br />

</div>

<br />

on this day, we decided to go to kamakura. this was in our iternary, and there were a few
places that we wanted to visit. \
\
to start off, most of the friends i was living with ended up sleeping in a bit, so i went to meet with the other friends
by myself. it was approximately a 90 minute train ride (with multiple transfers), but the view was 
well worth it. 

<br />

<br />


i met up with my two friends at the coastline, and we went to 
<a href="https://yoridocoro.com/en">cafe yoridokoro</a> for breakfast. the food was delicious! \
\
afterwards, we walked around the neighhborhood for a bit. we were really surprised to hear how quiet it was.
it was definitely one of the most peaceful places i have ever been to. \
\
all the people that we talked to were extremely nice and welcoming. for example, we wanted to go to 
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Ej71NCG8mw7gsvv6" target="_blank">goryo shrine (location cited)</a>, 
but we only had 10 yen coins (which is considered non-optimal for offerings). a woman ended up overhearing us
and was willing to trade us 5 yen coins for the 10 yen coins that we had. on top of this, another woman that worked
at a small pastry shop was also willing to give us some coins. of course, we bought some pastries from her shop afterwards.

at this point, it was around 2pm, and we met up with the rest of our friends. from there, we wanted to see the 
giant buddha statue at <a href="https://www.kotoku-in.jp/en/" target="_blank">kotoku-in</a>. 
it was fairly close to the coastline, so we just decided to walk there.

<br />

the buddha statue was absolutely massive. it was a bit surreal to see it in person. \
\
afterwards, we decided to go to <a href="https://www.hasedera.jp/en/about/" target="_blank">hasedara temple</a>. \
there was a lot of stuff to see there, including a koi pond, multiple shrines and a beautiful view of the city.

<br />

<br />
after this, we split up again for dinner. my group found a really nice okonomiyaki place (950 yen each).
for reference, okonomiyaki is a savory pancake that is made with a variety of ingredients (usually up to the chef or customer).
it was really delicious!

<br />

after that, we took the 2 hour train ride back to our airbnb. we were all pretty tired, so we just went to bed.
all in all, this day trip was probably my favorite day. we got to explore outside of tokyo, and we got to see many beautiful sights. 
very good impression of japan so far!

<br />

## january 13th: ginza
in the morning, some of us decided to go to the <a href="https://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/" target="_blank">tsukiji outer market</a>
to check out some of the food. i got a wagyu beef skewer for 1000 yen, and it was some of the best beef i have ever had.

<br />

we also decided to buy some sea urchins. i didn't even know that people could eat these,
but they were actually really good! they were also a bit expensive (reasonably so).

<br />

<br />

afterwards, we went to <a href="https://www.ito-ya.co.jp/lang/en/index.html" target="_blank">itoya</a> in ginza. 
this is a really famous stationery store in japan, and it was a really cool place to check out. 
there were 11 floors of stationary! each floor had a differen theme, and it was really bougee.
the part that i found the most interesting was the calligraphy section - who knew that pens could be so expensive and high quality? \
\
for lunch, i wanted to split from the group and try some station food. i had no idea how it worked!
it took me a while to muster up the courage to observe the locals, but i eventually figured it out. 

<BlogList>
<li> you buy a ticket from a vending machine </li>
<li> you give the ticket to the chef </li>
<li> you wait for your food in your mini-booth</li>
</BlogList>

this part was pretty simple, but i was a bit confused about the ettiquete.
i didn't want to spend too long reading the japanese on the vending machine, so i waited 
until there was no line. \
\
after ordering my food, i was instructed to sit in a booth.
eventually, my food arrived! i ended up buying a udon noodle soup with tempura for 850 yen.
for "station" food, it was really good! it definitely shattered my expectations on what kind of food i could get at a train station.

<br />

after meeting back up with my friends, we went to uniqlo to see what they had. 
there were a lot of floors, and we didn't get to explore all of them. \
\
i decided to split up with the group again for the evening. i wandered around a bit and eventually found the
<a href="https://fng.or.jp/koukyo/" target="_blank">kokyo gaien national garden</a>. it was a beautiful park
with minimal decoration and a lot of history.

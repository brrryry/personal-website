## Portfolio Website

Hi! I'm Bryan, and this is my portfolio website!

### Why on Github?

I put this repository publicly on Github to show that I can - in fact - spin up a website using a modern framework. If the skill is gonna be on my resume, I might as well show that I can do it!

(You can try to clone/reuse this repository, but it won't really work...)

### Deployment

Currently, this website is deployed on a [UGreen Network-Attached Storage (NAS)](https://nas.ugreen.com/) device that I own. This NAS runs a few docker containers that are relevant to this website! For more (and slightly outdated) details, check out [this blog](https://bryanchan.org/blog/pdev-ep2-cicd)!
